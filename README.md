## Data Warehouse for Stock Market Analytics 📊

A modern data warehouse solution designed for end-to-end stock market analytics. This project ingests real-time and historical market data from public APIs, processes it for analytical consumption, and presents insights via intuitive dashboards.  

### 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable stock market analytics platform using modern data stack components.  

### Key Features:

1. Real-time & historical stock data ingestion from public APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
2. ELT pipeline with dbt for transforming raw data into an OLAP-optimized model
3. Analytical dashboards for tracking:
- Stock volatility
- Sector performance
- Market trends & indicators

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- Layer	Tool	Purpose
- Ingestion	Airbyte / Fivetran	Extract data from Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage
- Data Warehouse	Snowflake / BigQuery	Store raw and transformed data
- Transformation	dbt	Data modeling & transformation
- Visualization	Looker / Tableau	Create analytical dashboards

### 📦 What I Build
1. Data Ingestion
   
Use Airbyte or Fivetran to pull data from:
- Yahoo Finance (stocks, historical prices, volumes)
- Alpha Vantage (technical indicators, sectors)
  
Load raw data directly into the cloud warehouse.

2. Storage & Modeling
   
Use Data Vault modeling to manage change over time and ensure scalability.  
Raw data is staged and incrementally loaded into OLAP-friendly dimensional models via dbt.  

3. Transformation with dbt
   
Create incremental models for price history and indicators.  
Apply warehouse performance best practices (e.g., materializations, partitioning, clustering).  

4. Dashboards & Analysis
Build interactive dashboards to visualize:
- Market volatility by time and sector
- Moving averages and technical indicators
- Sector-wise performance comparison

### 🧠 Advanced Concepts
Concept	Description
Data Vault Modeling	Flexible modeling technique to handle historical data, schema changes, and data lineage.
Incremental Models	Efficient dbt models that update only new data, reducing compute cost.
Warehouse Tuning	Optimizing queries and storage with clustering, partitioning, caching, and indexing techniques in Snowflake/BigQuery.
